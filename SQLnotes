DATABASE:
1) A database is an organized collection of data stored in a computer system and usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS).
The data in common databases is modeled in tables, making querying and processing efficient. Structured query language (SQL) is commonly used for data querying and writing.

2) The Database is an essential part of our life. We encounter several activities that involve our interaction with databases, for example in the bank, in the railway station, 
in school, in a grocery store, etc. These are the instances where we need to store a large amount of data in one place and fetch these data easily.
