WHERE CLAUSE:-

WHERE keyword is used for fetching filtered data in a result set. It is used to fetch data according to particular criteria. WHERE keyword can also be used to filter data by matching patterns.

Syntax:


SELECT column1,column2 FROM table_name WHERE column_name operator value;


Parameter Explanation:

column1,column2: fields in the table
table_name: name of table
column_name: name of field used for filtering the data
operator: operation to be considered for filtering
value: exact value or pattern to get related data in result 

Query:

CREATE TABLE Emp1(
    EmpID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(50),
    Country VARCHAR(50),
    Age int(2),
  mob int(10)
);
-- Insert some sample data into the Customers table
INSERT INTO Emp1 (EmpID, Name,Country, Age, mob)
VALUES (1, 'Shubham',  'India','23','738479734'),
       (2, 'Aman ',  'Australia','21','436789555'),

ORDER BY in SQL
The ORDER BY statement in SQL is used to sort the fetched data in either ascending or descending according to one or more columns. It is very useful to present data in a structured manner.

SQL ORDER BY default mode is sorting data into ascending order. To sort data in descending order use the DESC keyword with ORDER BY clause.

Syntax
The syntax to use ORDER BY clause in SQL is:

SELECT * FROM table_name ORDER BY column_name ASC | DESC


Key Terms:

table_name: name of the table.
column_name: name of the column according to which the data is needed to be arranged.
ASC: to sort the data in ascending order.
DESC: to sort the data in descending orde

The GROUP BY Statement in SQL is used to arrange identical data into groups with the help of some functions. i.e. if a particular column has the same values in different rows then it will arrange these rows in a group. 

Features
GROUP BY clause is used with the SELECT statement.
In the query, the GROUP BY clause is placed after the WHERE clause.
In the query, the GROUP BY clause is placed before the ORDER BY clause if used.
In the query, the Group BY clause is placed before the Having clause.
Place condition in the having clause.

Syntax:-

SELECT column1, function_name(column2)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column1, column2
ORDER BY column1, column2;

The LIMIT clause in SQL allows users to control the amount of data retrieved and displayed in the result set.

It is useful when only a subset of records is needed for analysis or display purposes in large databases with thousands of records.

Syntax :-
The Syntax to use LIMIT in SQL is:

SELECT column1, column2, â€¦
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
ORDER BY column
LIMIT [offset,] row_count;


Here,
offset: number of rows to skip before returning the result set.
row_count: number of rows to return in the result set.
